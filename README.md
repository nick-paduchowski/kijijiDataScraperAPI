# kijijiDataScraperAPI
This is an API I'm currently developing since I noticed on RAPID API there wasn't an API that served Kijiji Ad Data. Planning to use PostgreSQL as a database to store the data so I don't have to scrap the website every time someone makes a request. Should eventually be able to query by category, date, and price.
